        <p>
            Algebra isn't just a subject I study in school — it's a foundation for my journey in Computer Science.
            Variables, functions, and equations help me write programs, debug code, and think logically.

    <!-- ==== ABOUT COURSE ==== -->
    <section id="about-course">
        <h2>About Course</h2>

        <p>
            This course helped me understand that algebra is more than rules — it is a form of logical thinking.
            It trains the mind to analyze, simplify, and solve.

    <!-- ==== MY LEARNING ==== -->
    <section id="my-learning">
        <h2>My Learning</h2>

           <p>This semester, I discovered that algebra is more than numbers and formulas-it's about thinking logically and solving problems step by step. Each lessontaught me patience, persistence, and how to approach
                  challenges with confidence. As you practice, they become less like complicated rules and more like easy steps to solve math problems.</p>

    <!-- ==== REFLECTION ==== -->
    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>My Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            My Reflection on Algebra at first, algebra felt somewhat confusing and overwhelming. Balancing equations, factoring expressions, and which seemed a puzzle I was working with inequalities ouldn't solve. But as the semester went on, I began to see the pattern and logic behind each problem.
           I came to realize that algebra isn't all about getting the right answer-it's about understanding the process and thinking step by step. Through activities like solving word problems and Throughout this learning process, especially in simplifying expressions, I learned patience andpersistence. 
           I learned that making mistakes is part of learning, and every mistake is a chance to improve. Algebra has not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also taught me to approach with confidence and a clear mind. Now, I see algebra as more than a subject-it's a tool that exercises my thought processes, strengthens my self-assurance, 
           and prepares me to face problems in school and in life with focus and determination.</p>
